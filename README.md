# TwikkerApp
Final Project for CS50 Web Development. Its is a same looking-working website with Twitter


## Final Project of Cs50s Web Programming with Python and Javascript

This final project is ultimately a combination of 9 weeks lesssons and 5 assignments we have done so far. I created a website with
Django Framework in the back-end with 6 different modals and Javascript for the for the front-end development, in which;

- users can post (with images optionally), 
- display other users profiles and see their information and profile picture,prevoius posts and previous liked posts,
- follows them, views which users they are following, which users are following them.
- like their post, view which other users liked their posts
- and directly message them. 
- Users can view their previously liked posts in their profile page.
- Users can delete their own posts.
- Users, in the notifications page, will see their interactions with other users such as who followed them and when or who liked their post and when.
- In the who to follow section, users will see suggestions for who to follow, users will be changing randomly each time visited the website.
- I used Twitter API so in the Trends section users can view constantly-changing trend topics, if clicks on a trend, they will be redirect to Twitter's that trend page.
- In search button, if users search on something, it will display the results of search in Twitter original search page.
- This website is mobile-responsive.
